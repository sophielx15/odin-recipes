    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Baklava</strong> is a traditional pastry made of flaky layers of phyllo dough, filled with crushed nuts and
        sweetened with a lightly spiced honey syrup. This dessert is so delicious that it has Greeks and Turks
        fighting over its origin. Making baklava isn't difficult, but it does take some time and patience.</p>

        <li>Prepare the syrup. Pour water, lemon juice, vanilla extract,
            sugar, honey, orange peel and cinnamon stick into a saucepan. 
            Let the mixture simmer for 15 minutes. Place the pan in the fridge
            to cool completely.</li>
        <li>Chop the walnuts into tiny pieces and place into a container. Mix
            with cinnamon powder and ground cloves. Set aside for later use.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. </li>

    </ol>

    <p>Assembly</p>
    <ol start="5">
        <li>Take out a large baking dish and brush the bottom and sides with melted butter.</li>
        <li>To make the bottom layer of the baklava, lay down 8 sheets of phyllo dough into the bottom of the baking dish. 
            Between every 2 sheets, brush the phyllo dough with butter.
            Cover the phyllo dough with a damp paper towel as you work to prevent it from drying out.</li>
        <li>When you have laid down 8 sheets in total, put down a thin layer of the walnut mixture</li>
        <li>Continue this pattern of butter, thin layer of walnuts, 2 sheets of phyllo dough, butter, walnuts, etc.</li>
        <li>The top layer of the baklava can have 6 sheets of phyllo dough, again buttering every 2.</li>
        <li>Use a sharp knife to cut four horizontal lines, and then make diagonal cuts.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for about 40 minutes or until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Once your baklava comes out of the oven, pour the cold syrup on top.</li>
        <li>Voila! You have finished your baklava! Enjoy warm or refridgerated. Sticky fingers are unavoidable.</li>
