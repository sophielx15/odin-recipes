    <h1>Butternut Squash Soup</h1>
    <img src="../images/butternut-squash-soup.jpg" alt="bowl of orange soup">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My favorite fall tradition is making <strong>butternut squash soup</strong> on Sunday afternoons. On a brisk day, there's nothing more soothing than 
        chopping and simmering vegetables over a warm stove. As you cook, the kitchen fills with the cozy scent of autumn spices and butternut 
        squash, and when you're finished, steaming bowls of butternut squash soup (that will last all week!) reward you for your work.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Fresh butternut squash (3 lbs)</li>
        <li>4 large carrots</li>
        <li>1 large white onion</li>
        <li>5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>Chicken stock (4 cups)</li>
        <li>Spoonful of maple syrup</li>
        <li>Spices: (measured with the heart)
            <ul>
                <li>Salt, pepper, cayenne, smoked paprika, nutmeg, cinnamon, turmeric (optional)</li>
            </ul>
     </ul>
